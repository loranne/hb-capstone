# hb-capstone planning phase

## PT remix 

Would allow users to input variables like time and equipment available, pain levels/other movement restrictions, and generate a physical therapy routine for the day. Ideally would feature visual aids, and have access for therapist to add/modify exercises on their end (not likely to happen with v. 1). 

*Things I'll need/features to consider:*
- workout API. Look at Google Fit API. This might be better than the alternative, which is:
- or way for user to input exercise details
- Timer
- Visual representations of each exercise and equipment item

## Cosplay tracker

Cosplanner already exists, but looks like it's no longer supported on Android? This would do similar things, without any social angle. User can upload reference photos, keep a budget, break tasks down into "find, build, make" type categories, and set a calendar with deadlines for different stages. Also want functionality for expanding on an existing project even after it's marked completed. In a perfect world, could also help select cosplay project, if I can get the right API with characters. Support for mash-ups.

*Things I'll need/features to consider:*
- Investigate Fandom/Wikia API as a way to get reference photos and character data
- Calendar and budget APIs
- Lots of forms
- To-do list
- Photo uploading
