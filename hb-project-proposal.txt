## Project Proposal

### Overview

A webapp where users can generate a daily physical therapy routine, based on constraints like time, equipment available, and target area(s).

### Technologies required (besides typical Hackbright tech stack)

- Web scraping (probably Beautiful Soup)
- Calendar API (2.0)

### Data

- Exercise descriptions, time, equipment needed, target area
    - Visual reference would be great
- User needs
- Routine (list of exercises for the day)
- Past routines generated

### Roadmap

#### MVP

- Users can view a routine at the push of a button
- Constraints for routines:
    - Time
    - Equipment
    - Target (leg, ankle, arm, etc.)

#### 2.0

- Calendar (for prompting with reminder)
- User log-in (maybe?)
- Remembers previous routines

#### 3.0

- Maybe activity logging (but I think this is feature creep)
